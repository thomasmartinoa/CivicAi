You are a senior AI systems architect and backend engineer.
Design and generate the architecture, workflow logic, and code scaffolding for an Autonomous AI-Driven Government Infrastructure Resolution System that automates the end-to-end lifecycle of public infrastructure complaints using a multi-agent AI architecture.
The system must focus strictly on government infrastructure-related complaints in the following categories:
ROADS → Potholes, cracks, broken dividers
ELECTRICITY → Streetlight failure, hanging wires, transformer faults
WATER → Pipe burst, contamination, no supply
SANITATION → Garbage overflow, drain blockage
PUBLIC SPACES → Park damage, fallen trees, broken benches
EDUCATION → School building damage, toilet issues
HEALTH → Hospital waste, broken ambulance access
FLOODING → Waterlogging, drain overflow
FIRE HAZARD → Gas leak, illegal burning, electrical spark
CONSTRUCTION → Illegal construction, road excavation not repaired
STRAY ANIMALS → Dangerous stray dogs, cattle on highway
SEWAGE → Open manholes, sewage overflow

Do NOT include non-infrastructure grievances.
SYSTEM OBJECTIVE
Build a modular multi-agent backend system that:
Accepts complaints (text, voice, image, GPS)

Validates and structures the complaint
Classifies it into one of the defined infrastructure categories
Assesses risk and assigns priority score
Maps it to correct government department
Identifies correct jurisdiction level (Ward → Block → District → City)
Selects appropriate private contractor based on scoring model
Automatically generates digital work order
Tracks SLA deadlines
Escalates if unresolved
Updates citizen with status
Generates infrastructure analytics and performance metrics

CONSTRAINTS
Do not assume real government API integration
Use mock officer and contractor database
Focus on architecture clarity and clean code
Avoid hallucinated external systems
